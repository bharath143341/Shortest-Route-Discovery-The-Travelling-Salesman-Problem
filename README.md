# RL-for-TSP


## Overview

This project compares solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using both Q-Learning and a Integrating A3c (Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic) approach with a neural network. The Q-Learning algorithm is based on tabular Q-values, while the A3C approach utilizes a neural networks.


### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- TensorFlow (for Q-Learning)
- multiprocessing (for A3C)
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib


  #### Q-Learning Parameters

    num_cities, num_episodes, epsilon, alpha, gamma 

  #### A3C Parameters

    num_cities, global_ep_max, gamma
